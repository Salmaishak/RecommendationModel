Breakfast: the buffet breakfast has a variety of options (sweets, different types of bread, vegetables, eggs, meat, omelette and crepes made at the moment, coffee and juices). The breakfast time is from 7 to 10 am and at 10 am they start already removing food and coffee machine, they were not very flexible although people were still eating.   Rooms: in our first stay we originally had reservation for a bungalow but when we arrived it was ""upgraded"" to a normal room with pool/sea view. The room was clean, with bottled water and clean towels. The safe in the closet was broken, but in the end there is no need to use it. Although it is stated that WiFi is not available in the room, we could reach it from the balcony or downstairs in the hall.  In our second stay we had a room with city view. We arrived in the weekend and there were more people compared to the first stay. So it was a bit noisy until 1 am.  The fridge and airco can also be quite noisy. In the morning the fire alarm rang (by mistake) and the staff started the room service before the check out time so they knocked our door while we were still sleeping.   Position: zya is in Sigala, on the main street full of restaurants and bazaars. From the hotel you can easily reach the marina (around 10 min walking). Hurghada old town is about 5 km (so we took a taxi).   Beach: we enjoyed our time at the beach,  we also rented masks for snorkeling (5 euro for 2 masks in total). Drawback:  The music at the beach at 11 am was very loud and we had to ask multiple times to switch it off.   Overall we paid around 22 euro per person per night so we believe that it is a very good deal considering that a 5-star hotel is much more expensive. ZYA is clean and quite comfortable so it is a good deal if you are willing to accept that it is not a fancy hotel.…",Hurghada,27.2198577,33.8379527,"27.2198577,33.8379527",$,https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQpZ7xWYY4QyKCrSkjTGiNuw1nTjIwgkydLIDjG5-5PVKwhRygrOoVlnog38g&s

When we arrived the man behind reception was rude and said I needed to pay double the amount paid to Expedia for the room, even thou I had already paid in full to Expedia. Then he told me it was because two people where sleeping in the one room. Yet on the Expedia website we had paid for 2 people sleeping in the one room. At reception they made me feel belittled. The manager then asked me to pay in cash more as it was Expedia fault and I needed to pay double. I explained I wouldnât be given them anymore for Expedia mistakes that they needed to take it up with them! Even after I showed the hotel that I had paid the correct balance, they still wanted more from me. After an hour of standing at reception a man came along and explained it was not my fault and they had to take it up with h Expedia directly we where given a room. The was dirty. The bin was full and the lights didnât work in the room. We had travelled by bus from Giza to Alexandria for Eid celebrations, we where tired. Yet the directions to hotel when we booked said 2 meter walk into main Alexandria. It was miles away from Alexandria!!!  We both decided after the treatment we had at reception and the dirty state of the room to just get in a taxis and not stay in this hotel.

I often stayed there as a single woman in Cairo, and they always took good care of me! I have spent hundreds of days there over the last 30 years. I spent a lot of 2020 here, as my apartment was being renovated. The staff made me feel it was my second home.  The hotel is thoroughly cleaned every day. It was redecorated in the last couple years. The building is 1920s style, with high ceilings, balconies with great views of the city, ceiling fans, and lots of charm. The old, original elevator works well--it might take some getting used to, but it is regularly maintained, so you can count on it. If it ever does not work once, the owner gets it checked right away, because he won't be able to stay in business without it. If you find the stairways dirty or the airshaft dirty--these things are typical in Egypt and not something the hotel can do anything about, since they own the eighth floor, but not the building.  The owner, Ashraf, is very kind and accommodating to your needs, as well as an excellent source of information about any where you need to go, how to renew your visa, how to open a bank account, and whatever else you need. The staff are respectful and very honest.   Breakfast is bread, cheese and jam, plus an egg! Most budget places in Egypt don't include an egg. Cold drinks, water, tea and coffee are available at cheap prices. If you want to order a full Egyptian breakfast, it is excellent and not very expensive. Plus with the app ""Talabat,"" you can order from hundreds of area restaurants, if you don't feel like going out. Reception staff can help you order.  There are two suites with AC and a bathroom inside. The other rooms can some with a bathroo or you share the bathrooms, but many are available and cleaned multiple times a day. The bathtubs are clean, but old. It's time to redo the porcelain on them. But they work well and are clean.  You can hang out in the reception area to meet other travelers. They are mostly students, budget travelers an occasional businessman from Saudi. If you want any tour, Ashraf can arrange it, as well as transportation wherever you want, including the airport. He is very honest, which is sometimes not easy to find in Egypt.  The location is the best! Busses and a Metro stop are right in front of you, while taxis are plentiful and not expensive. There are new Uber busses or Svwl busses or cars you can book on apps for fair prices.  The balcony views of Tahrir Square, the Egyptian Museum or the old American University of Cairo campus are fantastic.

The girl from reception started to speak with us for check-in, after somebody else comes (an egyptian) and let us just like this, for 10 minute, without no information.  All of them want money from everything. They showed a book with some activities that they organize (Giza Piramids, Cairo) and when we said ""thank you"" politely, because we already booked, she started to do some facial expressions... The room was dirty, we found some packages near the windows... Unfortunately, I did not take some pictures. Also, they start to serve the breakfast after 9, 9.30, we said that we need to go to visit and the visits starts early in the morning, but just they don't care. It was needed me to yell to him to have the breakfast at 8.30 (an acceptable hour, after me). And, the last lie was the transfer to airport. They proposed us to get to airport and we accepted (for 250 LE - triple than the Uber). We also asked and paid one more night there till our flight (that was at 4am) because my husband twisted his ankle. We agreed with them to get us at 00.30 (so, with a lot of time in advance) from hotel. The girl told us that it takes one hour to arrive at the airport. At 23, they came to our door saying that 'the driver is already here and the way to airport is very crowded'. I said that i think it's ok because we have tine until the flight, but to be sure, we accepted to leave at 00.00. After 20 minutes, they came back and said that we need to go now because the way is blocked because of some works. They hurry us to leave the room (even if we paid the completely night). My thought is that they did not register the payment (all was cash) and all of them kept the money for one night (624 LE). And guess what, we made 20 minutes till the airport ...no trafic and no works. All was a lie just to make us leave faster. As i said before, i think that they shared the money between them.

When my daughter got stain on the walls the manager was very courteous and accommodating. They also brought for me flowers and fruit per my family's request.  I took a 3 bedroom suite which was an apartment. Each bedroom had a queen size bed. There was also a dining area, salon area, kitchen, and bathroom. The style was a bit outdated but the availability and convenience of everything made up for it. There was microwave, fridge, toaster, oven, kitchenware, ironing board, tv, and desks.   I appreciated the cleanliness- everything was covered in plastic and sanitized.   Breakfast was very basic with boiled egg, jam, bread, cheese, OJ, tea/nescafe.   Delivery is easy through talabat app where I ordered things from the pharmacy and other restaurants. The hotel is keen about safety so no delivery persons come to the room, instead the concierge will carry up the item and you give him the money. I made sure to leave a tip for both him and the person delivering.  There are also a few restaurants and cafes downstairs although I didn't try any. One is particularly famous in Maadi for breakfast called Ovio (?).  The location is quiet, removed from the hustle and bustle of Cairo, and a view of trees and greenery specific to Maadi.

L’arrivée à « l’hôtel » se fait par l’une des artères principales du cente-ville, ou par une petite ruelle au charme « coupe-gorge », si vous arrivez du mauvais côté. Arrivés en bas du bâtiment, nous n’avons trouvé aucune indication/pancarte confirmant la présence de l’établissement, et c’est grâce aux avis laissés sur différents sites que nous nous sommes rendus au 5eme étage pour le check-in. Prenant possession de notre chambre, nous avons pu constater que les draps étaient sales (présence de nombreuses tâches et cheveux/poils de précédents occupants, Cf photos). Malgré tout, et fatigués d’une intense journée, nous nous sommes empressés d’aller nous coucher et avons immédiatement noté l’absence totale d’insonorisation, résultant en une charmante nuit blanche. Le centre-ville du Caire ressemble à un gigantesque cortège de mariage avec ses coups de klaxons incessants de 6h à 1h30, s’en suivent les aboiements des chiens errants de 1h30 à 4h30-5h et enfin l’appel à la prière. Autant dire si vous aspirez à passer une nuit paisible, un autre établissement avec un minimum d’insonorisation sera tout indiqué. Pour passer le temps durant ces nombreuses heures à tourner et retourner dans notre lit, nous avons été gratifiés de multiples démangeaisons ne laissant guère de doute sur leur origine : de belles piqûres en rang d’oignons témoignant de la présence de punaises de lit plutôt voraces. Si vous êtes malgré tout tentés de séjourner dans ce lieu immonde, assurez-vous que votre gabarit vous permette de profiter des toilettes sans vous cogner dans le mur se trouvant face à vous (idéal pour travailler un mouvement de squats bien vertical). Attention également aux bouteilles d’eau fournies par l’établissement qui sont en réalité des bouteilles de récupération remplies à la fontaine : si la tourista vous effraie, nous vous recommandons plutôt de vous approvisionner à l’épicerie située au bout de la petite ruelle précédemment évoquée.

563,Regency Hotel,2,3000,Children Activities (Kid / Family Friendly),"3 Abdel Azim Rashed St., Cairo 11511 Egypt","The Regency Hotel in Cairo is located in the Giza suburb of Dokki a fair walk from downtown Cairo on the west bank of the Nile, aka the crappy side. It is off a busy highway & around the corner from a ladies club. If this doesnt raise your suspicions about this being the wrong Regency Hotel perhaps the hand painted hotel sign will.  Room 506 has seen better days about a decade ago. After enjoying the release of emptying my bowels the toilet wouldnt flush & there wasnt any toilet paper. There was a 28cm tv, mini fridge & aircon. Bedsheets looked sort of gungy & the carpet was fairly dirty. The reception dudes spoke little english but knew how to ask for tips. I played a game of charades with them to try & explain the toilet problem. It was very entertaining, we eventually changed rooms to an equally poor room.  The hotel is housed in the sort of neighbourhood you would go to if you were homeless. Stray dogs & garbage are the main features here if you like to take photos. There are no computers in the hotel, the reception desk used paper & pen! The 80's has come back in fashion here.  The hotel resturant has cobbwebs on the locked door, this is probably not good so avoid even asking for food, just call KFC for takeaway 19019.  The previous review from 2 years ago basically describes our experience word for word, so in 2 years nothing had improved, indeed its pretty shabby.

Le personnel n'est pas du tout souriant et très peu aimable. Très loin de l'hospitalité africaine. L'accueil est inexistant.   Première fois en 15 ans que je tombe sur un hôtel aussi médiocre.  Scandaleux et honteux de mettre des descriptions non conformes.  1/ À quelques heures de s'enregistrer (une fois que l'annulation n'est plus possible) on reçoit un mail pour nous signaler que l'hôtel n'est réservé qu'aux égyptiens et que les nourritures et boissons extérieures sont complètement interdites dans l'enceinte. Aucuns de ces points n'aient signalés lors de la réservation ou sur le descriptif en ligne.  2/ Surprise au moment de s'enregistrer, le prix bloqué à la réservation à augmenté de 15% et l'hôtesse nous apprend qu'on doit ajouter 60$ à ce prix car nous sommes non résidents égyptiens.  DES VOLEURS!!   Face à notre refus d'ajouter autant elle baisse la somme de 70% en quelques secondes (taxe à la tête du client!!! Honteux !  3/ Ils proposent soit disant des chambres doubles mais au moment de découvrir la chambre on s'aperçoit qu'elle est avec 2 lits simples, on appelle l'accueil pour signaler que ce n'est pas ce que nous avions réservés. L'hôtesse nous répond simplement que dans cet hôtel toutes les chambres sont en lits séparés.   4/ La chambre est sommaire.   Odeur d'humidité et marque d'humidité sur les murs   Quant à la literie, elle n'est pas du tout confortable.  Juste une serviette de toilette, pas de serviettes pour les mains, cheveux ou même de tapis de bain... Pas de câble TV, uniquement les chaînes locales...  5/ Petit déjeuner inexistant,   même pas de café ou de lait, juste une bouilloire d'eau chaude, obligé d'aller se restaurer à côté pour avoir quelques choses de convenable à se mettre sous la dent.

And as for the view from the terrace…breathtaking! You have a clear unobstructed view of the great pyramids which is literally minutes away. I could never tire of this view and actually felt very emotional when I caught my first glimpse. Every day Mohammed checks in with you to make sure you are having the best possible experience. He is funny, friendly and we all got along famously. Mohammed has a fiend and driver called Deesha who we used nearly every day. His English, like Mohammed’s, is very good and he also has a great sense of humour - he’s also a safe and excellent driver which is essential in Egypt!  I have always wanted to see the pyramids so as a birthday treat, my husband obliged. On the night in question, Mohammed, Sam and his mother presented me with the most delicious birthday cake which he later shared with all the other guests. This is so typical of this lovely family.

So for me it was complete with everything I needed. You wouldn’t think that this place is just minutes away from the Giza pyramids. Either by horse or car it’s right there practically. Yes it’s so tranquil, away from city noise especially with the horses. They’re so serene and calming. So it’s the perfect place if u want something quiet and secluded almost felt like a retreat house yet very close to the desert and pyramids.   Staff is most attentive starting with Ali who always let me know that I can call him anytime. He’s there 24/7 unless he’s out on an errand. Sharif was very helpful with my sunrise ride in Giza desert and in teaching me some Arabic. Owners are very personable and hospitable. They serve a delicious Turkish coffee at a minimum charge. Ahmed their stable boy has a beautiful smile. I luv what I call the community room. People gathered there to talk or watch tv including the owners. When I stayed there, a couple of other female guests and I would meet  either here or right beside it where they had a couple of outdoor wooden couches by the corral.   Note that internet is weak, towels are smaller and breakfast is very simple but at least they are provided. Some places in Giza charge for towels (eg Draz etc). You have a choice between a room with a private shower and toilet or use the shared facilities. Be sure to turn on the heater before u shower or water will be a tad cold.   Luved the rooftop terrace. It is spacious. There is a beautiful view from there both at day and night. You can eat there, just enjoy the view out pray whatever u want.

I don't know how many rooms have interconnecting doors, but ours did. Room 101 has a locked inter-connecting door with room 102. You can hear everything in room 102 that goes on, including zipping of suitcases, very loudly and clearly.  Obviously this works both ways. Whilst the hotel cannot in any way be responsible for selfish, unthinking, self opinionated a*****s that book a room; they are responsible for the interconnecting doors. These doors should be replaced with a proper sound insulated wall. Having d****s knocking on doors, talking loudly both in their room and in corridors, laughing, unzipping suitcases, and anything else they do in the early hours can be clearly heard through interconnecting doors.

The manager of the hotel, Mohammed El-Komaty, is a super manager and very handsome young man. The hotel is very very clean, well appointed, and very private. You can’t beat the price and it includes breakfast! I would much rather stay here for $20 a night instead of five star hotels which run around $200 plus a night!    I have lived in Egypt for seven years now, but I always come from Luxor where I live, and stay here just to be with my old friends because I used to live here 10 years. The people here are like family. When I came this time, they had fresh fruit and  candy bars because they know I love chocolate, as well as my own private tea and coffee maker for the room. I am a writer so it’s important for me to have a quiet place in which to dream.  Right outside my door is a small patio where I sit, with table and chairs, surrounded by lovely little plants and wonderful little birds who live in the air conditioning unit above me. They sing every morning.  I love them. They are used to me now. I feed them bread and give them water.   Upstairs is a spectacular porch overlooking the three pyramids and great sphinx. This is where you go to have your breakfast or you can have your dinner up there. You can watch the sound and light show and admire the beauty in front of you.  The beautiful thing is, you walk downstairs and out your door and you were right by the Great Sphinx. No need to take a taxi! You can go in from that direction and walk all around the Giza plateau. Also, there is a lovely little market where I buy all my supplies for staying here for up to a month.. Around the corner is a lovely fruit stand where you can buy fresh fruit daily. There is also a pharmacy and numerous gift shops.   This time, I stayed for two weeks and it cost me the same amount as one night at a five star hotel! What is lovely is if you call Mohammed for something he will bring it. I needed a charger. He brought one for me to borrow until I go back home. All of that in five seconds too. If you need a car to the airport or need a car driver he’s on it. He also had a driver waiting for me when I arrived at the airport with a sign from the hotel. That was a wonderful service!  One of the things I love about this little hotel as it is out of the way. It’s very very quiet. The only thing is, you have to climb a few stairs, ( he’s hoping to get an elevator put in soon. )!However, I look at it is a form of exercise! I am 75 years old!  I just take my time going up the stairs!  Also, there are no stupid security checks like at the hotel, where you have to wait to be checked every time you go in. And best of all, you really do get to meet the people of Egypt. You find them to be the warmest and most beautiful people! You make lifelong friends here in the Village.  There are stables downstairs as well as carriages within walking distance. You can rent a horse or a carriage and see the whole place. I saved so much money on hotel and taxis I could afford to rent a private driver for a week!

Faru told us promises of amazing photography of the Giza Pyramids in the morning and incredible camel riding experience ect ect. We eventually agreed on a price of $230 USD for both myself and my wife for this tour. The next day we did the tour with our guide named Mohammed who took us on a very rushed tour NOT PRIVATE skipping over 50 percent of Giza (the part we were most interested in) and at the end I asked what about the camel tour? He replied that he didn’t know anything about camels being involved in this 4 person tour… After we arrived back to the hotel to speak to the manager Mohammed. At first Mohammed tried to blame us that we didn’t do the camel tour and after a couple more excuses ect ect he refunded us 80 USD of the money we paid and he pocketed the rest. Unfortunately this is Egypt and we took the small portion refund and learned a lesson. In the end Mohammed the hotel manager, Faru and the guide Mohammed scammed us by giving us the “basic” pyramid tour package valued at approximately $55 USD for 2 people in a group tour and they pocketed the rest of the money.

The ship is in very good condition.  Of all the other boats we saw during our cruise, the BlueShadow appeared the newest and in the best condition. The ship is clean and the staff are friendly and accommodating.    The cabins are well-furnished, modern, and spacious (larger than those found on mega cruise ships). Our room had a large window and flatscreen TV, the bed was comfortable, the bathroom had a shower/tub combo and there is ample closet space.   We traveled in July, with outside temps of 113 degrees Farenheit.  The boat is kept cool, almost too cool.  I recommend that you pack a sweatshirt or fleece for the common areas as the AC is blasting nearly non-stop. It made for a refreshing contrast when returning from the boat after several hours signtseeing in the intense Egyptian summer heat.  The food service is good for a boat of this size. All meal service is buffet style, and there is sufficient variety such that you should be able to find a food to your liking.  The daily Egyptian Dish specials were particularly good. Wait staff was attentive with clearing plates and serving beverages.  Water is not included, but a 1.5L bottle costs less than $2 US. We spent about $20 US total on water for the entire four-day cruise, which I thought was reasonable. The sun deck has ample space and a small pool to cool off in. We spent hours reclined under the canopy watching life unfold on the banks of the river.  It was very tranquil and provided a unique perspective on life in Egypt  outside Cairo.  This is THE way to see Egypt, both ancient and modern.

We were promised wifi and I paid for a certain level of accomodations.  Instead they only had wifi in the lobbies (you can only check in and out in one, the rest are purely decorative and for saying ""go to the main lobby""), but in the rooms there was none, and I had to buy a local sim in the hotel store. The owner of the shop sold 2 sims- to me and my brother, one of them didn't work, but the owner didn't admit to a thing.  Door was constantly getting stuck and the sink drain didn't work. Sink was fixed on the same day, the door- on day 4.   Cleaning: they mop the floor, but don't change the sheets- the staff just turned them over. I know because it was the same stain.   Food: Acceptable. Not wow, acceptable. Some plates and cups were chipped and cutlery was filthy.  On day 3 we were offered a compensation dinner in one of the a-la-carte restauraunts. I was told it was for the repairs. When I was offered to sign a waver, I saw that it was for a DOWNGRADE of the room I was NOT notified of. Too bad I read what I sign.   But I'm the forgiving type. So I decided to pretend it's acceptable. We went to the dinner- and 2 out our party of 6 got food poisoning.  Mosquitoes. But no nets or zappers. And no spraying or any other measures taken. Luckily I brought repellent from home.   Kids club- another promised feature. About 3 square meters and no AC in airtight room. Saunas aren't safe in this age, just so you know.   The airport is nearby. Either the windows are shut completely, or you don't sleep that night.

We have celebrated a birthday of my 4 year old daughter during our stay and animation team and russian speaking manager of the hotel done a really great job to make us feel festive! They have decorated our room as a piece of art, baked the cake, brought it to our room and in the evening after the mini disco the Event manager made a great little happy birthday party for our daughter! Couldnt celebrate better than that and I would say million thanks to Amira, Margarita, Ahmed and other animators for being so warm, welcoming and nice to us!! We will remember this day! Thank you thank you thank you! you've done a really great job! The fire show was also a blast!! Mini disco every day at 20.30 folowing some sort of show for adults like fire show or belly dance.   Beach was nice and The sea is beautiful! This is definately a must see! The shuttle from the hotel goes every hour but you can walk about 15 mins to the beach yourself to get some excercise. We've done that every day. The path is easy but lots of rubbish in the area. I wonder why the hotels dont make their staff to clean not only inside of the hotel but also around it. Animation team could come to the beach more often to spend some time with guests doing zumba and playing volleyball. We have seen them only once for 1 day and they said there were not enough animators.  The Restaurant. First few days was fab. After that it was a mess. Salty soup for 3 days, salty fish. This was a first time for me when I refuse to eat food in the restaurant. An improvement on the menu is needed. Loads of greens though, many fruits including fresh figs, strawberries, guavas, grape, apples, delicious dry plums, etc - this is a 5*. Food in first few days was amazing! Fresh grill outside, inside so many choices of food and everythng we've tried was delicious. After summit guests were gone there was no more vegetarian options. We had a 1 day dinner in the small Italian restaurant where the buffet was transfered due to a little amount of guetsts in the hotel and were offered to choose the main meal while the rest was in a buffet style. This was a disaster. So salty grilled fish and soup.. left hungry. The next day there was no food in the beach cafe. And we stayed hungry until the evening. And again salty soup in the evening.. Morning pancakes and waffles recepie needs improvement. Not tasty and cold, had to ask to make fresh for me every time but still took ages and was too dry due to the grill not heated enough and it took long time for panckaes to cook. Eggs and omelets were fab! Cereals sections needs no sugar addition like sugar free muesli. Music in the dining area is disturbing therefore we were eating outside the restaurant all the time. Beach cafe needs improvement as well. As they do french fries and chicken in advance, everything gets cold and this is served to the guestes. Evrything has to be made fresh including french fries. Staff over there doesn't do any other job than that. They just stare at the phones all the time and serve cold potatoes. Fruits are there thannks for that. First aid needs to be completed with scissors (they dont have them and plaster has been cut by the safe guard).   Staff is very friendly and helpful - this is a highlight. I've had a help wherever i go. But  they do require a bit more knowledge of english. And the guy that sells excursions in the hotel is very friendly (thank you) but super annoying.  Room was awesome! huge and bed, pillows were very comfy. View from the balcony was on the pool and mountains. Amazing! Everything you could possibly need is there: bottle of water for every person, coffee station, kettle, plenty of fresh towels. Cleaned every day.  Music from the pool area in the morning was amazing. Loved it! Quiet and peaceful. The 2 minus: staff needs training on how to wash floors - not good. And our hot water was yellow colour.…",Sharm El Sheikh,27.8715023,34.3052277,"27.8715023,34.3052277",$,https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR6oLnK58oO628t5m63juyyDIbulg4BOiRS7eZ9Y5-JzGIEX8AXkUmJ_MEtNA&s

They said that they would give my tour guide a refund and then because we didn’t change rooms they refused. So we ended up having to pay even though we had such a horrible experience.  We were ready to leave on the spot but couldn’t find another place to stay because we arrived so late. Do yourself a favor and read the reviews on booking.com. They may seem funny, but they are all very accurate. I’m not sure why most people made negative comments, but then gave a high rating. It makes no sense to me.

The hotel has a small area, closed from the wind. An excellent pool is the only decoration of the hotel. I can not recommend staying at this hotel for recreation. Only for a short period between travels or excursions or while waiting for a flight home. It makes no sense to book  meals because the food is extremely limited. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. However, management overestimates the value of the hotel and is very distant from the desire to work hard over the renovation and reconstruction of the hotel.

Хамовитый персонал, очереди в столовке (назвать это рестораном язык не повернется). Бассейны грязные, стремноватые, хлоркой воняют. Зачем их закрывают в 17.00 - загадка, ни разу не видела, чтоб их чистили. Кофе в столовке - помои без всяких переносных смыслов. За грилем нужно стоять в очереди. Бывают фрукты, неплохие. Территория красивая. Выглядят бассейны шикарно (днем, ночью их не подсвечивают). Мест для фотографирования куча. Отдельно могу сказать о пляже и море. Невзирая на мелочи в виде  поломанного понтона, море шикарное. Пляж находится в небольшой бухте, благодаря этому красный флаг почти не поднимали, купайся сколько угодно. Глубина небольшая, рыбок много,  от понтона протянуты веревки - очень удобно. Ехать туда можно только ради моря. На пляже обслуживание тоже отвратительное, перекусы выглядят противно - кусок теста, на нем клякса томатной пасты, и 3 соломинки картошки. Пиво теплое, то нема, то нету. Публика в отеле соотвествующая - чисто СНГ, немного арабов. Я очень общительный человек, но тут ни с кем не хотелось даже разговаривать - кроме семьи беларусов и грузин. Мой вывод: лучше не экономить настолько. Еще 100 баксов к путевке - и отдыхаешь, как человек. А анимация хорошая!

I witnessed one child throwing up on the food court floor. This was wiped with a mop using no water or disinfectant. The mop was taken straight back into the kitchen.

1289,Domina Aquamarine Hotel & Resort,4,3500,,,"My parents visited sharm for first time and I booked for them Domina for 5 days. As my parents first time out of their country, they enjoyed so much.  The big plug of the hotel - sea, beach, wellness zone, not bad food. One of the best place to make snorkeling.  From my side I would say big thanks for Mr Mahmoud sales manager, who met us and gave full welcoming, hospitality and respect. For Mr. Mohamed Shahat for his great staff and his great job. Also I would mention the reception staff - so patient and everything organized.  The big minus of the hotel concierge service - which give bad impression about the hotel; staff around the hotel, who doesn’t give service, don’t know any English word. No any information about bus, how to move around the hotel as the territory is too big.  Also paper cups, even at the main restaurant. Rooms a dated. The entertainment team do not engage with the guests at all, but evening shows are nice.  However the hotel is very nice. The credit of the hotel is beach and sea.

Next the bathroom, No towels or toilet rolls that were included in 'equipment supplied' The shower tray was engrained with dirt and had no curtain.

It has to be the worst hotel we have ever stayed in to date.   We checked in and was gave a room that was supposedly the best room. The room looked like it hadn't been cleaned for years,  the room was filled with dust, the curtains where dirty and half hanging off, the bed sheets where old, dirty and had little bubbles all over like it had been used over a million times. There was rubbish left on our bathroom floor which included bits of fruit?? The shower head had mould and the shower was extremely dirty.  The hotel is placed on top of steep hill. The man made stairs will take you straight down to naama bay but be careful as if you miss a step, you will drop and severely injure yourself or possible death. At night there are no lights on the stairs so it's extremely hard to climb the stairs in the dark as it's stairs that are made up of mud.  The pool was GREEN, not blue and it looked like he hadn't been cleaned for months.  The only night we stayed, our room neighbours partied all night in front of the pool until around 6am. There was screaming, shouting and loud music for the whole night. If we opened our curtains, the people outside could directly see into our room.   We had booked at 7 night stay but after the first night we wanted to check out. The hotel caused a fuss when we did want to check out as we told them the problem with the room - they told us we wasn't allowed to check out and we need to contact our holiday rep. Our holiday rep did not leave any contact details so we couldn't contact him. The hotel had no details of the holiday rep either so they insisted we needed to stay. They tried to force us to stay but we didn't want too.   The room has no wifi connection so the next morning we went to the Starbucks in naama bay and jumped onto booking.com and booked at a hotel we have previously stayed at - Falcon Naama Star Hotel.   Upon leaving the hotel, the service desk refused to check us out again suggesting that it was necessary to stay. We told them that they cannot force us to stay and we are leaving and they can't stop us. We took our bags to the stair case where they had security. Yet AGAIN the security guards tried to stop us from leaving saying we are not allowed to check out until our holiday was over. We told them if they don't let us go we will have to report them.   Please do not stay at this hotel, we was made to feel like we wasn't allowed to leave with the hotel forcing us to stay.   Save yourself the hassle and book else where.
